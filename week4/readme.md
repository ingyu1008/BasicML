## Introduction to Neural Networks

This week covers basic concept of the neural networks. However, the learning algorithm(back propagation) is a bit complicated. Thus, the back propagation algorithm and the math behind it will be covered next week.

This week's LAB session only consists of Programming Assignment provided by Coursera. (Not uploaded to github)
